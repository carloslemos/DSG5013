    "text": "Given the situation described above, we must assume that there are many students who are forced to write a thesis so that they may graduate quickly and obtain the career advancement that originally motivated their university enrollment. Some of these students may be as old as 40. They will ask for instructions on how to write a thesis in a month, in such a way as to receive a passing grade and graduate quickly. We should then say resolutely, this book is not for them. If these are their needs, if they are the victims of paradoxical legal circumstances that force them to graduate so they may resolve painful financial matters, they would be much better served by the following options: (a) Invest a reasonable amount of money in having a thesis written by a second party. (b) Copy a thesis that was written a few years prior for another institution. (It is better not to copy a book currently in print, even if it was written in a foreign language. If the professor is even minimally informed on the topic, he will be aware of the book’s existence. Clearly the two pieces of advice we have just offered are illegal. They are similar to advising an emergency room patient to put a knife to the throat of a doctor who refuses to treat him. These are desperate acts. We give this paradoxical advice to emphasize that this book does not attempt to resolve the serious temporal and financial problems that many university students currently face.",

    "text": "The computer, which since the early 1960s has been used as a production tool, has now become a universal media machine—a tool used not only for production, but also for storage and distribution. The World Wide Web crystallizes this new condition; on the level of language, this fact is recognized around 1990 when the term “digital media” comes to be used along with “computer graphics.”\nWhat else can be said about 1995? The Soviet Union, where I was born, no longer exists. With its demise, the tensions that for decades animated creative imaginations both in the East and the West—between freedom and confinement, interactivity and predetermination, consumerism in the West and “spirituality” in the East—disappear. What takes their place? A triumph of consumerism, commercial culture (based on stereotypes and limited clichés), megacorporations that lay claim to such basic categories as space, time, and the future (“Where Do You Want to Go Today?” ads by Microsoft; “Internet Time” by Swatch, which breaks twenty-four hours into 1,000 Swatch “beats”; “You will” ads by AT&T), and “globalization” (a term at least as elusive as “spirituality”).\nWhat also arrives by 1995 is the Internet—the most material and visible sign of globalization. And by the end of the decade it will also become clear that the gradual computerization of culture will eventually transform all of it. So, invoking the old Marxist model of base and superstructure, we can say that if the economic base of modern society from the 1950s onward starts to shift toward a service and information economy, becoming by the 1970s a so-called post-industrial society (Daniel Bell), and then later a “network society” (Manual Castells), by the 1990s the superstructure starts to feel the full impact of this change. If the postmodernism of the 1980s is the first sign of this shift still to come—still weak, still possible to ignore—the 1990s’ rapid transformation of culture into e-culture, of computers into universal culture carriers, of media into new media, demands that we rethink our categories and models.\nToday we are witnessing the emergence of a new medium—the metamedium of the digital computer. In contrast to a hundred years ago, when cinema was coming into being, we are fully aware of the significance of this new media revolution.",

    "text": "Writing a thesis requires a student to organize ideas and data, to work methodically, and to build an “object” that in principle will serve others. In reality, the research experience matters more than the topic.\nAt the very least, writing a thesis is like training the memory. One will retain a good memory when he is old if he has trained it when he was young.\nFinally, we have preserved Eco’s handwritten index card research system in all its detail, precisely because it is the soul of How to Write a Thesis. Obviously the card catalog of the small town library is primitive compared to today’s online research systems, but the research skills that Eco teaches are perhaps even more relevant today. Eco’s system demands critical thinking, resourcefulness, creativity, attention to detail, and academic pride and humility; these are precisely the skills that aid students overwhelmed by the ever-growing demands made on their time and resources, and confused by the seemingly endless torrents of information available to them. Much as today’s college students lug laptops to the library in their backpacks, Eco’s students lugged their files of index cards. Today’s students carry access to boundless information that Eco’s students could not have begun to fathom, but Eco’s students owned every word they carried. They meticulously curated every byte of information, and they enjoyed the profound rewards of both the process and the product.",

The humanities are the process of preservation and appropriation of that pastness, a process that requires specific skills acquired through practice, as all skills are.\nThe humanities are intrinsically creative and innovative. They are about originality and invention, not discovery.\nAmong the many causes of today’s crisis in the humanities is the fact that there is a loss of concrete practices and capabilities—of experiences where one must “work methodically,” of opportunities “to build an object.” It is a crisis long in the making.",

Develop action, thought, and desires by proliferation, juxtaposition, and disjunction, and not by subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization.\n2. Withdraw allegiance from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which Western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality. Prefer what is positive and multiple, difference over uniformity, flows over unities, mobile arrangements over systems. Believe that what is productive is not sedentary but nomadic.\n3. Do not think that one has to be sad in order to be militant, even though the thing one is fighting is abominable. It is the connection of desire to reality (and not its retreat into the forms of representation) that possesses revolutionary force.\n4. Do not use thought to ground a political practice in Truth; nor political action to discredit, as mere speculation, a line of thought. Use political practice as an intensifier of thought, and analysis as a multiplier of the forms and domains for the intervention of political action.\n5. Do not demand of politics that it restore the \"rights\" of the individual, as philosophy has defined them. The individual is the product of power. What is needed is to \"de-individualize\" by means of multiplication and displacement, diverse combinations. The group must not be the organic bond uniting hierarchized individuals, but a constant generator of de-individualization.\n6. Do not become enamored of power.",

    "text": "Suppose that a man pulls the trigger of a gun. Mechanistically, the muscles in his index finger contracted because they were stimulated by a neuron having an action potential (i.e., being in a particularly excited state). That neuron in turn had its action potential because it was stimulated by the neuron just upstream. Which had its own action potential because of the next neuron upstream. And so on. Here’s the challenge to a free willer: Find me the neuron that started this process in this man’s brain, the neuron that had an action potential for no reason, where no neuron spoke to it just before. Then show me that this neuron’s actions were not influenced by whether the man was tired, hungry, stressed, or in pain at the time. That nothing about this neuron’s function was altered by the sights, sounds, smells, and so on, experienced by the man in the previous minutes, nor by the levels of any hormones marinating his brain in the previous hours to days, nor whether he had experienced a life-changing event in recent months or years. And show me that this neuron’s supposedly freely willed functioning wasn’t affected by the man’s genes, or by the lifelong changes in regulation of those genes caused by experiences during his childhood. Nor by levels of hormones he was exposed to as a fetus, when that brain was being constructed. Nor by the centuries of history and ecology that shaped the invention of the culture in which he was raised. Show me a neuron being a causeless cause in this total sense. The prominent compatibilist philosopher Alfred Mele of Florida State University emphatically feels that requiring something like that of free will is setting the bar “absurdly high.”[6] But this bar is neither absurd nor too high. Show me a neuron (or a group of neurons, or an entire brain) whose generation of a behavior is independent of the sum of its biological past, and for the purposes of this book, you’ve demonstrated free will. The point of the first half of this book is to establish that this can’t be shown.",

On the contrary, we have come to see its history as a succession of distinct and equally expressive languages, each with its own aesthetic variables, and each closing off some of the possibilities of its predecessor (a cultural logic not dissimilar to Thomas Kuhn’s analysis of scientific paradigms). Similarly, every stage in the history of computer media offers its own aesthetic opportunities, as well as its own vision of the future: in short, its own “research paradigm.” \nHow do conventions and techniques of old media—such as the rectangular frame, mobile viewpoint, and montage—operate in new media? If we construct an archeology connecting new computer-based techniques of media creation with previous techniques of representation and simulation, where should we locate the essential historical breaks?\nHow do conventions and techniques of old media—such as the rectangular frame, mobile viewpoint, and montage—operate in new media?

    "text": "But I did not know then that the message is effective only if the receiver is ready for it (most people were not) and if the messenger is identifiable and reliable.\nWhat I sensed then, and believe now, is that power is based on the control of communication and information, be it the macro-power of the state and media corporations or the micro-power of organizations of all sorts. And so, my struggle for free communication, my primitive, purple-ink blog of the time, was indeed an act of defiance, and the fascists, from their perspective, were right to try to catch us and shut us off, so closing the channels connecting individual minds to the public mind. Power is more than communication, and communication is more than power. But power relies on the control of communication, as counterpower depends on breaking through such control. And mass communication, the communication that potentially reaches society at large, is shaped and managed by power relationships, rooted in the business of media and the politics of the state. Communication power is at the heart of the structure and dynamics of society.\nMy working hypothesis is that the most fundamental form of power lies in the ability to shape the human mind. The way we feel and think determines the way we act, both individually and collectively.\nFurthermore, the process of institutionalizing norms and rules and the challenge to these norms and rules by actors who do not feel adequately represented in the workings of the system go on simultaneously, in a relentless movement of reproduction of society and production of social change. If the fundamental battle about the definition of the norms of society, and the application of these norms in everyday life, revolves around the shaping of the human mind, communication is central to this battle. Because it is through communication that the human mind interacts with its social and natural environment. This process of communication operates according to the structure, culture, organization, and technology of communication in a given society. The communication process decisively mediates the way in which power relationships are constructed and challenged in every domain of social practice, including political practice.\nTo explain how power is constructed in our minds through communication processes, we need to go beyond how and by whom messages are originated in the process of power-making and transmitted/ formatted in the electronic networks of communication. We must also understand how they are processed in the networks of the brain. It is in the specific forms of connection between networks of communication and meaning in our world and networks of communication and meaning in our brains that the mechanisms of power-making can ultimately be identified.\nTo advance the construction of a grounded theory of power in the network society (which, for me, is tantamount to a theory of communication power), I will focus my effort on studying the current processes of asserting political power and counterpower, by using available scholarly research on the matter, and conducting a number of case studies in a diversity of social and cultural contexts. However, we know that political power is only one dimension of power, as power relationships are constructed in a complex interaction between multiple spheres of social practice. And so, my empirical analysis will be necessarily incomplete, although I hope to stimulate a similar analytical perspective for the study of power in other dimensions, such as culture, technology, finance, production, or consumption.\nIn this book, I combine my own expertise on sociopolitical analysis and the study of communication technologies with the works of scholars investigating the interaction between the brain and political power in order to build a body of observation that may provide a measure of the relevance of this interdisciplinary approach. I have explored the sources of political power relationships in our world by trying to link the structural dynamics of the network society, the transformation of the communication system, the interaction between emotion, cognition, and political behavior, and the study of politics and social movements in a variety of contexts.",

Its aim is to inquire into the concept of rationality that underlies our contemporary industrial culture, in order to discover whether this concept does not contain defects that vitiate it essentially… The present potentialities of social achievement surpass the expectations of all the philosophers and statesmen who have ever outlined in utopian programs the idea of a truly human society. Yet there is a universal feeling of fear and disillusionment. The hopes of mankind seem to be farther from fulfillment today than they were even in the groping epochs when they were first formulated by humanists. It seems that even as technical knowledge expands the horizon of man’s thought and activity, his autonomy as an individual, his ability to resist the growing apparatus of mass manipulation, his power of imagination, his independent judgment appear to be reduced. Advance in technical facilities for enlightenment is accompanied by a process of dehumanization. Thus progress threatens to nullify the very goal it is supposed to realize—the idea of man.",

    "text": "The man who looks for security, even in the mind, is like a man who would chop off his limbs in order to have artificial ones which will give him no pain or trouble. No pain, no trouble—this is the neurotic's dream of a tranquilized and conflict-free existence. Such a set of beliefs, Deleuze and Guattari demonstrate, such a herd instinct, is based on the desire to be led, the desire to have someone else legislate life. The very desire that was brought so glaringly into focus in Europe with Hitler, Mussolini, and fascism; the desire that is still at work, making us all sick, today.\n'How could the masses be made to desire their own repression?' \nThe man of ressentiment, as Nietzsche explains, \"loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors, everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment; he understands how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble.\" Such a man, Nietzsche concludes, needs very much to believe in some neutral, independent \"subject\"—the ego—for he is prompted by an instinct of self-affirmation and Jeff-preservation that cares little about preserving or affirming life, an instinct \"in which every lie is sanctified.\" This is the realm of the silent majority.",

Lacan's description makes it clear that something strange is going on: it is as if some figure of the other – in this case, the Chorus – can take over from us and experience for us our innermost and most spontaneous feelings and attitudes, inclusive of crying and laughing.\nIt is as if some figure of the Other can take over from us and experience for us our innermost and most spontaneous feelings and attitudes.”\nSuch a displacement of our most intimate feelings and attitudes onto some figure of the Other is at the very core of Lacan’s notion of the big Other.\nThe object itself takes from me, deprives me of, my own passivity, so that it is the object itself that enjoys the show instead of me, relieving me of the duty to enjoy myself.\nI am passive through the Other: I concede to the Other the passive aspect (enjoying) of my experience, while I can remain actively engaged.\nSomething strange occurs when a figure of the ‘other’ can express our most intimate and spontaneous emotions on our behalf.",

In so doing the author is not trying to suggest anything like a program of action. On the contrary, he believes that the modern propensity to translate every idea into action, or into active abstinence from action, is one of the symptoms of the present cultural crisis: action for action’s sake is in no way superior to thought for thought’s sake, and is perhaps even inferior to it. As understood and practiced in our civilization, progressive rationalization tends, in my opinion, to obliterate that very substance of reason in the name of which this progress is espoused.",

    "text": "The nineteenth century develops a first form of modern cynical consciousness that links a rigorous cynicism of means with an equally rigid moralism of ends. For as far as the ends were concerned, scarcely anyone risked imagining a real region beyond good and evil - for that would be ‘nihilism.’ Resisting nihilism is the real ideological war of modernity. If fascism and communism struggle somewhere on a common front, it is on the front against ‘nihilism,’ which with one voice is attributed to ‘bourgeois decadence. Common to both is the resoluteness to oppose the \"nihilistic\" trend with an absolute value: Here the people's Utopia, there the communist Utopia. Both guarantee a final end that sanctifies every means and that promises to give meaning to existence. However, where radical cynicism of means comes together with a resolute moralism of ends, there, the last residue of moral feeling for the means dies out. Modern, heavily armed moralism works itself up into an unheard-of destructive whirlwind and drives the hell of good intentions to an extreme.",

    "text": "The relentless drumbeat of inevitabilist messages presents the new apparatus of ubiquity as the product of technological forces that operate beyond human agency and the choices of communities, an implacable movement that originates outside history and exerts a momentum that in some vague way drives toward the perfection of the species and the planet. The image of technology as an autonomous force with unavoidable actions and consequences has been employed across the centuries to erase the fingerprints of power and absolve it of responsibility. (…) Every doctrine of inevitability carries a weaponized virus of moral nihilism programmed to target human agency and delete resistance and creativity from the text of human possibility. Inevitability rhetoric is a cunning fraud designed to render us helpless and passive in the face of implacable forces that are and must always be indifferent to the merely human. This is the world of the robotized interface, where technologies work their will, resolutely protecting power from challenge. ",

(…) a key feature of digital platforms and applications is that they make available a ‘grammar of action’, action formats – or inform-actional formats – designed to make certain activities ‘more doable’ in digital settings – ‘like liking’, ‘following’ and ‘flagging’ – and in one and the same go, these formats render these activities available for analysis and intervention.",

    "text": "If one considers an image as a measuring device, then one should ignore chance and subjectivity. To conceive of a photographic image as a measuring device is to insist on the mathematicality, calculability, and finally the \"computability\" of the image-world. (…) Vilém Flusser has remarked that digital technology is already found in embryonic form in photography, because the photographic image is built up out of points and decomposes into points. The human eye synthesizes the points into an image. A machine can capture the same image, without any consciousness or experience of the form, by situating the image points in a coordinate system. The continuous sign-system image thereby becomes divisible into \"discrete\" units; it can be transmitted and reproduced. A code is thus obtained that comprehends images. This leads one to activate the code and to create new images out of the code language. Images without originals become possible - generated images. ",

    "text": "Although vision suggests sight as a physical operation, and visuality sight as a social fact, the two are not opposed as nature to culture: vision is social\nand historical too, and visuality involves the body and the psyche. Yet neither are they identical: here, the difference between the terms signals a difference within the visual — between the mechanism of sight and its historical techniques, between the datum of vision and its discursive determinations—a difference,\nmany differences, among how we see, how we are able, allowed, or made to see, and how we see this seeing or the unseen therein. With its own rhetoric and representations, each scopic regime seeks to close out these differences: to make of its many social visualities one essential vision, or to order them in a natural hierarchy of sight.",

    "text": "VR, telepresence, and interactivity are made possible by the recent technology of the digital computer. However, they are made real by a much older technology — the screen. It is by looking at a screen — a flat, rectangular surface positioned at some distance from the eyes— that the user experiences the illusion of navigating through virtual spaces, of being physically present somewhere else or of being hailed by the computer itself. If computers have become a common presence in our culture only in the last decade, the screen, on the ocher hand, has been used to present visual information for centuries - from Renaissance painting to twentieth-century cinema. \nToday, coupled with the computer, the screen is rapidly becoming the\nmain means of accessing any kind of information, be it still images, moving\nimages, or text.

    "text": "Today’s technological infrastructures of connection are varied. They include digital platforms such as Facebook and Alibaba that we are familiar with, the whole mass of corporate intranets, and any detailed interfaces for linking up persons, things, and processes for data transfer. Infrastructures of connection enable data colonialism to be more subtle than historical colonialism in how it appropriates resources. Historical colonialism appropriated territories and bodies through extreme physical violence. Data colonialism works through distinctive kinds of force that ensure compliance within interlocking systems of extraction in everyday life.",

More often, the specificities of the technical processes of recognition are discussed and debated within the field of the computer and cognitive sciences, separated from any cultural investigation. When AFR technology has been discussed within cultural studies, it is for the most part treated as a monolithic method rather than as a variety of different methods that have evolved in specific ways.

    "text": "Não há dúvida de que a longo prazo todas estas memórias serão modeladas\nem grande medida pelas tecnologias digitais e pelos seus efeitos, mas elas não serão redutíveis a eles. Insistir numa separação radical entre memória \"real\" e virtual choca-me tanto quanto um quixotismo, quando menos porque qualquer coisa recordada - pela memória vivida ou imaginada - é virtual por sua própria natureza. A memória é sempre transitória, notoriamente não confiável e passível de esquecimento; em suma, ela é humana e social. ",
